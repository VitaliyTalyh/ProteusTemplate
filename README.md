The Steam/LAN is a blueprint-only template optimized for Oculus/Vive/WMR headsets, compatible with the latest Unreal Engine launcher version. Works with Steam Store, LAN, OculusDirect, DirectIP, Oculus Store (once references to Steam are removed)
The Oculus Store requires the Avatar plugin, thus requires compiling from Visual Studio; it also removes all references to Steam in order to be published on the Oculus Store.
The Windows Store is based on a branch of Unreal cured by Microsoft specifically tailored for Windows Mixed Reality headsets. The base template is blueprint only, but the Unreal Engine must be compiled from the Microsoft Dev/Mixed Reality GitHub.
The DirectIP with VOIP allows to use Direct with VOIP – following some plugin customization
